I faced any problems that is couldn't use **command** option of a **docker_container** module.

I need customize php-fpm container, so I used _**docker-php-ext-install**_ command in docker_container's command option.
But I had any struggle points.

My struggles..

1. I didn't recognize command option's reference detail.
  Is parameter type string? list?  fmm??
2. Importance of ENTRYPOINT(docker-php-entrypoint?? what's this?)
3. In using **command option,**Docker container shutting down immediately.
    * PHP-fpm container is uses exposed port. Why shutting down????

## How to

Let me get straight the point, this playbook is a my solution.

```yaml
- name: Deploy PHP7 on docker container
    docker_container:
      name: php7-fpm
      auto_remove: yes
      command: [
        "bash",
        "-c","
        'apt update && apt install zlib1g-dev && docker-php-ext-install zip && docker-php-ext-install pdo_mysql && php-fpm'"
      ]
      image: php:7-fpm
      exposed_ports:
        - 9000
      state: started
```

## Answer of my struggles

###  1.

A command option of docker_container can receive one of shell command.

["ping","127.0.0.1","-c","5"]

"ping 127.0.0.1 -c 5"

Both styles can use too.

### 2.

"docker-php-entrypoint" distinguish argument's `-`


If entrypoint option and command option that both have a some parameter, Executing that the command option is option of entrypoint's.

### 3.

PHP7-fpm docker container runs `php-fpm` shell command on the command that is equivalent of dockerfile's CMD directive.
However, my wrong playbook didn't have php-fpm command at last.
Therefore all commands successfully done, and container shutting down.

```yaml
command: [
        "bash","-c","'apt update && apt install zlib1g-dev && docker-php-ext-install zip && docker-php-ext-install pdo_mysql"
      ]
```

So, bash commands option helped my solution.

`"/bin/bash -c '{any commands of combined from &&}'"`
